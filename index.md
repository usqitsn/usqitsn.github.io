<p><em>What began as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/usqitsn/">Facebook group</a> of IT students developed into a USQ-affiliated student "club" that was founded in early 2018. In addition to bringing the wider community of USQ IT students together, we place a high priority on enhancing industry-readiness and providing professional development opportunities to students as we are able.</em></p>
